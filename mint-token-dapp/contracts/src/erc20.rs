//! Implementation of the ERC-20 standard
//!
//! The eponymous [`Erc20`] type provides all the standard methods,
//! and is intended to be inherited by other contract types.
//!
//! You can configure the behavior of [`Erc20`] via the [`Erc20Params`] trait,
//! which allows specifying the name, symbol, and decimals of the token.
//!
//! Note that this code is unaudited and not fit for production use.
