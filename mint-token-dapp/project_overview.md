## Smart Contract Architecture

### Contract Structure

The CandyToken contract is built using Rust and the Arbitrum Stylus SDK, which allows Rust code to be compiled to WebAssembly and executed on the Arbitrum network. The contract is structured as follows:

1. **lib.rs**: The main contract entry point that defines:
   - `CandyTokenParams`: Configuration for token name, symbol, and decimals
   - `CandyToken`: The main contract struct with the ERC20 implementation
   - Public functions for minting and burning tokens

2. **erc20.rs**: The core ERC20 implementation with:
   - Storage definitions for balances, allowances, and total supply
   - Event declarations for Transfer and Approval
   - Error handling for insufficient balances and allowances
   - Core ERC20 functions (transfer, approve, transferFrom, etc.)
   - Internal functions for minting and burning tokens

3. **main.rs**: A minimal binary target required for the Stylus deployment process

### Key Contract Features

- **Standard ERC20 Functionality**: Implements all standard ERC20 methods
- **Minting Capabilities**: Two minting functions:
  - `mint(value)`: Mints tokens to the caller's address
  - `mint_to(to, value)`: Mints tokens to a specified address
- **Burning Capability**: Allows users to burn their own tokens
- **No Owner Restrictions**: Unlike many ERC20 tokens, the CandyToken allows any user to mint tokens

## Frontend Architecture

### React Component Structure

1. **App.js**: The main application component that:
   - Manages wallet connection and network switching
   - Handles contract initialization and interaction
   - Manages state for token operations (mint, transfer)
   - Renders the UI components

2. **Components**:
   - **ConnectWallet.js**: Handles wallet connection and displays connection status
   - **CandyMachine.js**: A visual candy machine animation for the UI
   - **TokenForm.js**: Form components for token interactions

### Key Frontend Features

- **MetaMask Integration**: Detects MetaMask, handles connection, and manages account changes
- **Network Management**: Checks if the user is on Arbitrum Sepolia and provides network switching
- **Token Operations**:
  - Minting tokens to the user's address
  - Transferring tokens to other addresses (with validation to prevent self-transfers)
- **Real-time Updates**: Updates balances after operations and provides visual feedback
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error handling for wallet connection, contract interactions, and user inputs

## Contract-Frontend Integration

The integration between the smart contract and frontend is handled through:

1. **Contract ABI**: The `CandyToken.json` file contains the contract's ABI, which defines the interface for the frontend to interact with the contract.

2. **ethers.js**: The frontend uses ethers.js to:
   - Connect to the Ethereum provider (MetaMask)
   - Create contract instances
   - Send transactions to the contract
   - Handle BigNumber conversions for token amounts

3. **Configuration**: The `config.js` file contains:
   - The deployed contract address
   - Network configuration for Arbitrum Sepolia
   - Chain ID information for network validation

## Deployment Process

### Smart Contract Deployment

1. **Build the Contract**:
   ```bash
   cd contracts
   cargo build --release
   ```

2. **Generate ABI**:
   ```bash
   cargo stylus export-abi
   ```

3. **Deploy to Arbitrum Sepolia**:
   ```bash
   cargo stylus deploy \
     --private-key YOUR_PRIVATE_KEY \
     --network arbitrum-sepolia \
     --wasm-file-path target/wasm32-unknown-unknown/release/stylus_erc20.wasm
   ```

4. **Activate the Contract**:
   ```bash
   cargo stylus activate \
     --private-key YOUR_PRIVATE_KEY \
     --network arbitrum-sepolia \
     --address 0x49c31b473c3efbe8f5384eb7b77c257a961c8fc8
   ```

5. **Cache the Contract** (optional, for gas optimization):
   ```bash
   cargo stylus cache bid 0x49c31b473c3efbe8f5384eb7b77c257a961c8fc8 0
   ```

### Frontend Deployment

1. **Install Dependencies**:
   ```bash
   cd react-frontend
   npm install
   ```

2. **Update Configuration**:
   - Set the correct contract address in `src/config.js`
   - Ensure the ABI in `src/contracts/CandyToken.json` is up to date

3. **Start Development Server**:
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

4. **Build for Production** (optional):
   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```
