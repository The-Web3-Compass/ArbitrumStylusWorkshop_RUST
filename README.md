# Arbitrum Stylus Rust Examples

This repository contains example projects demonstrating how to build applications using Arbitrum Stylus with Rust. Each project showcases different aspects of Stylus development and can be used as a reference for building your own applications.

## Projects

### 1. Counter Example (`my-counter`)

A simple counter application built with Arbitrum Stylus and Rust. This example demonstrates the basics of Stylus contract development including:

- Setting up a Rust project for Stylus
- Implementing basic state storage
- Creating public methods for incrementing and reading a counter
- Deploying to Arbitrum Sepolia testnet

### 2. CandyToken dApp (`mint-token-dapp`)

A complete ERC20 token implementation with a React frontend. This project showcases:

- Building an ERC20 token contract using Rust and Stylus SDK
- Implementing token minting and transfer functionality
- Creating a React frontend with ethers.js integration
- Connecting to MetaMask and handling network switching
- Interacting with the deployed contract from the frontend
